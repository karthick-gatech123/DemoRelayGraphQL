# DemoRelayGraphQL
Simple prototype for Relay and GraphQL using open-source tools with standard JS on the frontend

Server: Node.js with express (for HTTP) and graphql.js (for GraphQL implementation). 
        graphql-relay-js to make our schema Relay-compliant.

Client: Standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no React). 
        use fetch to make the GraphQL requests.
